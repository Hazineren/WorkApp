# WorkApp

In our WorkApp application, current job postings, positions, position level and job position information are displayed to the user via API.
The user can navigate between the job posting pages with the back and forth buttons.
The 'Loading' animation is displayed so that the user does not encounter a blank screen while the job postings are brought to the home page.
Job details are shown when the user clicks on any job posting. The job detail data that came as HTML was printed to the screen with renderHTML.
The user can apply for a job or add to favorites. Adding and deleting to favorites was created with Redux structure.
Work list and favorites list have been created in the Drawer menu.
